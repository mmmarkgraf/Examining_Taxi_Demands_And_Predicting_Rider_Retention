# Examining_Taxi_Demands_And_Predicting_Rider_Retention
This script was used to tackle a stimulation of technical problems that could be seen in a job interview process.<br><br>
The topic of this stimulation was taxi drivers and riders, mainly covering data wrangling, data manipulation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), machine learning (specifically random forest and neural networks was used), and model analysis.<br><br>
To run this script, the files logins.json and ultimate_data_challenge.json must be in the same folder as this script. Then, simply run each cell in order.<br><br>
Note: Computation times may be longer than expected.
